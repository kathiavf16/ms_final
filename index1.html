                    for Russia, which earned the dubious distinction from the Aviation Safety Network of being the
                    deadliest place to fly in 2011.<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Why, according to the most recently available data, is flying in Russia
                    four times deadlier than the world average? In large part, the air industry here is a victim
                    of its own success: As the number of passengers has skyrocketed in recent years, airlines in Russia
                    have struggled to find enough qualified personnel. The result, experts
                    have said, is more under-trained, inexperienced and overconfident pilots.

                    alarming number of accidents, it is not a surprise that Aeroflot has the highest number of
                    fatalities. According to the Aircraft Crashes Record Office, 8,231 passengers have died in Aeroflot
                    crashes, about five times more than any other airline. From 1946 to 1989, the carrier was involved
                    in 721 incidents. However, from 1995 to 2017, the carrier was involved in 10 incidents. <br> <br>The
                    US Air Force is the
                    following with 3,392 fatalities. According to the Air Force Times, Air Force mishaps rose 16 percent
                    between 2013 and 2017, the years following the congressional budget cuts known as sequestration.
                    At least 133 service members were killed in those fiscal years 2013-2017 mishaps, according to data
                    obtained by Military Times.

                    According to the article "The year of flying dangerously: 1972",
                    There was 72 airliner crashes in 1972 (defined by the Aviation Safety Network as hull loss of a 14
                    seat or greater aircraft). Crashes were happening for age-old
                    reasons, chiefly controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and loss of control in flight (LOC), but to
                    new and larger aircraft. <a style="color: lightyellow; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; "

                    Some examples of each category can be found in the table. Since most aviation accidents are caused
